Geographe Electrical & Communications are a new electrical contracting business based in the South West town of Dunsborough providing both domestic electrical work and commercial electrical work to large scale businesses and the mining sector.
The business owner, Paul Scott, wanted a website to promote the various commercial and residential electrical services the business provides and to provide a way for potential clients to make enquiries.

The branding was originally designed by our good friends at Gravy Design - [gravydesign.com.au](http://gravydesign.com.au/){:target="_blank"}

The fully responsive site was developed using the Processwire Content Management System, allowing really easy management of new and existing content into the future.
