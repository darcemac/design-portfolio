Turkey Shoot is a action film based on the 1980s ozploitation classic of the same name. Unicorn Films, Melbourne, approached me with the need of establishing an online presence to help market the new film. The website provides a video teaser, stills and a film synopsis.

The website is fully responsive, so it looks great on all devices.
