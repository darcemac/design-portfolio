Opulence Events approached me to redesign and rebrand their existing website. Opulence Events also wanted their existing site split into two stand alone websites, Opulence Events and Opulence Weddings.
I developed a common page layout and navigation structure so that both sites had a familiar feel and useability, but stylistically they are different to suit each particular target audience.

I designed a new logo that is now better aligned and reflective of the services that Opulence Events provides. Note: The client has recently changed the logos for both sites and modified the splash page.

The projects were developed using Wordpress as the Content Management System, allowing the clients to easily add new content and manage all of the existing content into the future. Both sites are fully responsive for all devices.
