South West Eco Discoveries are a new Eco Tour business based in the picturesque South West town of Dunsborough. The tour operators, brothers Ryan and Michael White, wanted a website to promote the various tours they operate and to provide a way for customers to create tour bookings through the website.

We crafted a modern logo, with grounded sensibilites - Earth tones, bold typography and a touch of excitement, reflecting the two brothers passion for the South West.

The site is fully responsive for all devices and is built upon the Wordpress Content Management System, allowing Ryan and Micheal to easily manage the website into the future.
